This project extends the mrmath library with a few common image processing techniques:

  * rgb to matrix conversion and vice versa
  * Procrustes analysis
  * Delauny triangulation
  * Image warping based on a triangulation
  * Image warping based on thin plate splines
  * An Active Appearance Models framework including an annotation application and a model builder application

As a precondition for that project you also need to checkout
http://code.google.com/p/mrmath/ and put it to the projects search path!
